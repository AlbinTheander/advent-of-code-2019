Hate was o
Pain was my
Love was god

Let the time be nothing without nobody 
Listen to the lie
Until the lie is nothing
Let a memory at the time be the lie
Build the time up
Listen to the lie

Let the place be a memory without Hate
Let music be nothing

While the place is as big as nothing
Let the song be a memory at the place
Let the song be over Love
Turn it down
Let it be without Pain
Let music be with the song
Knock the place down


Shout music
