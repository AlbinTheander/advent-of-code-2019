# Advent of Code - Rockstar

We'll see if I have enough energy to do anything with this. But it's great fun!

To run the things, this repo includes a snapshot of the [Rockstar](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar) repo.

The current snapshot is at commit 00d7eb711df94c025337bb4793b3c29988a20177.

You need node installed to run the code. Look in `runAll.sh`and `runRock.js` to get some hints if you want to run the solutions yourself!
