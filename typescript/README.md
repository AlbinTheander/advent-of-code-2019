# Advent of code 2019 - TypeScript

To run the code, you need:

* node v13
* yarn v1.19 (may work with npm as well)

The versions specified are the ones I'm using. You can probably get by with earlier versions if necessary. Also, I'm on OSX, which may or may not affect some things. :-)

## Running the code

To install dependecies:
```bash
yarn
```

To run the code for all the days:
```
yarn start
```

To run the code for a single day:
```
yarn start <day-nr> # E.g. yarn start 3
```
